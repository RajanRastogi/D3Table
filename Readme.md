## D3Table

This project mainly aims at leveraging D3's data bringing capabilities to easily create tables.

The project is just a hobby project, so it might not be ready for production use, so your suggestions and contributions are welcomed.

Following are the features currently supported (v 0.0.1):

* Support for json, csv, tsv data formats

I know that's slim, so feel free to make feature requests.
